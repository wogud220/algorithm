# Fall 2017 Training

This repoistory serves as a place for consolidating 1) problems we went over in each session 2) our analysis for each problem and 3) each person's implementations for some or all of the problems.

# Session 1. 10.26.17'

## Problem 1)
	Given a set of x coordinates x1, x2, ..., xn and some rewards associated with each coordinate r1, r2, ..., rn, find the subset of x coordinates such that x_(i+1) - x_i >= 5 and the sum of corresponding r_i for each element in the subset is maximized.

	Approach 1) O(n^2) approach
		 
		 At each i positions, we have two choices. Case 1) inlcude r_i into the sum. 
		 					   Case 2) not include r_i into the sum.
		 Define dp[i] as the maximum sum generated from beginning to xi coordinate of either including or not                          including the r_i value.
		 	dp[i] = max( dp[k] + r_i (case1) , dp[i-1] (case2))
			base case: dp[0] = r_0
			In case1, because the constraint is the distance 5, we will have to iterate all the x positions before 			       i to find the latest position before i that satisfies greater than 5 condition, and we would choose 			   that position as the k value. Due to iteration we make to find the position that satisfies x_(i+1) -   			  x_i >= 5 for each x, time complexity becomes O(n^2).
		

	Approach 2) O(N) approach
		Similar to above, but we can figure out the lastest position which satisfies x_(i+1) - x_i >= 5 for each x 
		before we start. We can implement this by using two pointer. One pointer starting from x_0, and other one x_1.
		When this is done, in contrast to our first approach, we do not have to loop through the list each time, but 		     just use the information that we found before hand, and in a constant time can find the index of postion 		        that satisfies x_(i+1) - x_i >= 5. Because this means that we only need to go through the x coordinates once,                 the runtime is O(N).
	
	Approach 3) O(M)
		dp[i] is the maximum sum generated from beginning to i where 1<= i <= M, M = max distance.
		This method, instead of looking at each x position, we are looking at i miles on the highway. 
		Two cases:
			1. Not a valid spot for any billboards
			2. Valid spot for a billboard.
			      - Valid, but do not include this spot to the sum
			      - Valid, do include this spot to the sum
		Case 1, dp[i] is always dp[i-1], because we are for sure not including any new element.
		Case 2, dp[i] is max(dp[i-1], dp[i-5-1] + r_i), we compare the values sum of not including the spot, and 			including the spot.
		To apply this method, we have to make sure that x_1 < x_2 < ....<x_n-1 < x_n, specifying that the measure is 			in order.

## Problem 2)
	Same problem as Problem 1 with the added constraint that the subset has to be exactly of some given size K.
	
	dp[i][k] represents the maximum sum generated from beginning to x_i using k elements. x_i can be included or not 	 included. 
	Two cases: 1. Include x_i to the sum
	           2. Not include x_i to the sum
	dp[i] = max( dp[i-1][k], dp[e*][k-1] + arr[i]).  dp[i-1][k] is not using the x_i, and dp[e*][k-1] + arr[i] is using 	    the x_i element. Here e* represents the latest x position that satisfies x_(i) - x_e* >= 5 where e* < i. 
	The solution will be dp[len(arr)][k].
	
	

## Problem 3)
	Same problem as problem 2 except that the the subset can be of size upto some given size K.	
	
	Similar appoach to number 2, but instead of just setting the base case as dp[0][0] = 0, we nee to initialize dp[0]	  [0~k]= 0.
# Session 2. 10.27.17'
	
## Problem 1)
	Given a string S consisting of "(" and ")", check if the string is valid. A valid p-string is either 1) empty string, 2) "(" + p-string + ")", or 3) p-string + p-string.

	This problem can be solved using some sort of stack approach, but a DP approach is more applicable to the various variations of this problem.
	Define DP[i][j] as True if S[i:j] is a valid p-string, False otherwise. The final answer is DP[0][n-1].
	Recurrence:
	DP[i][j] = (if S[i]+S[j] = "()", DP[i+1][j-1]) or
		(DP[i][k] and DP[k+1][j] for all k = i+1, increment by 2, k<j)
	This directly follows from the recursive definition of p-strings. Either the string is enclosed by ( and ) and the inside is valid, or it is some combination of two possible p-strings. k increments by 2 because it is impossible for an odd-length p-string to be valid.
	The runtime of this algorithm is O(n^3) since for all n^2 entries, there are possibly up to O(n) operations.

## Problem 2)
	Given a p-string, find the longest valid subsequence.
	
	The solution to this problem is almost the same as problem 1.
	Define DP[i][j] as the length of the longest valid subsequence contained in S[i:j]. The final answer is DP[0][n-1].
	Recurrence:
	INC = 2 if S[i]+S[j] = "()", 0 otherwise.
	DP[i][j] = max(DP[i+1][j-1] + INC,
		(DP[i][k] + DP[k+1][j] for all k = i+1, increment by 2, k<j)).
	In a similar reasoning as problem 1, we simply go over every case of splitting the entry into smaller parts, and finding the one that gives the maximum valid subsequence.
	The runtime of this algorithm is O(n^3) since for all n^2 entries, there are possibly up to O(n) operations.

## Problem 3)
	Given a p-string, find the longest valid substring ***and its occurences***.
	
	Define DP[i] as the length of the longest valid substring starting with S[i]. The final answer is max(DP[i]).
	Recurrence:
	DP[i] = if S[i] = ")"
			0
		if S[i] = "(" and S[i+1] = ")"
			2 + DP[i+2]
		if S[i] = "(" and S[i+1] = "("
			if S[i + DP[i+1] + 1] = ")"
				2 + DP[i+1]
			else
				0
	Since DP[i] is defined to be starting at S[i], we simply need to go through every case. If S[i] is ")", then LVS is already invalid, thus the length is 0. If S[i] is "(" and S[i+1] is ")" then we can look at DP[i+2] and add two to that result. If S[i] and S[i+1] = "(", then two ")" must show up later. We find the longest occurence of this by looking at DP[i+1]. DP[i+1] tells us where the first ")" occurs, since DP[i+1] contains the length of the LVS. By summing i, this length, and 1, we are now at the index of S where the second ")" should occur, and we simply add 2 to DP[i+1]. If it does not occur, then there is no valid substring starting at S[i], thus the length is 0.
	
## Problem 4)
	Now, include [] and {} with the same constraints. Given a string containing of (){}[] and ?, find the total number of possible ways to replace the ? with one of ()[]{}. Ex) ([?) = 1, ???] = 3.
	
	The solution to this problem is almost the same as problem 1.
	Define DP[i][j] as the total number of ways to replace ? with ()[]{} in S[i:j]. The final answer is DP[0][n-1].
	Recurrence:
	INC = 3 if S[i]+S[j] = "??", 1 if S[i]+S[j] = "()", "?)", "(?". (check also for {,},[,], in similar fashion), 0 otherwise.
	DP[i][j] = max((DP[i+1][j-1] * INC),
		(DP[i][k] * DP[k+1][j] for all k = i+1, increment by 2, k<j)).
	In a similar reasoning as problem 1, we simply go over every case of splitting the entry into smaller parts, and finding the one that gives the maximum number of ways to replace ?. We multiply instead of adding like in problem 2 because we are multiplying the occurences of independent events.
	The runtime of this algorithm is O(n^3) since for all n^2 entries, there are possibly up to O(n) operations.

# Session 3. TBD.
## Problem 1)
Given a N x M grid of numbers all positive and <= 10000, you want to reach from the top left corner to the bottom right corner in the minimum number of steps. You can move from cell (i, j) to its adjacent neighbors if and only if the value of an adjacent cell is lower than that of cell (i, j).

## Problem 2)
Same problem except that you are interested in finding the number of all such paths (not necessarily minimum).

## Problem 3)
The computer memory can be conceptually thought of as an array A of N numbers. A memory cell A[i] has two values associated with it. m_i is how many bytes it represents and c_i is the cost of "free"-ing that memory cell. You want to run your favorite new game and need at least M bytes. Figure out the minimum cost sum of clearing memory cells such that you have M free bytes.

## Problem 4)
In an undirected tree (a graph that has no cycle and is connected), the diameter of a tree is defined to be the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. Give a recurrence relation that computes the diameter of a tree.

# (Informal) Session 5. 11.14.17'
## Problem 1)
Given a directed graph with N nodes and E edges where there is no negative sum cycle, you want to find the shortest path from node S to node T. To make the problem interesting, consider a set of one way flights F that connect you from node s_i to node e_i for each flight i and you can ride at most one flight. Find the shortest path from node S to node T that may include at most one such flight. Note that the number of N, E <= 10^6. You want to design an algorithm that runs under 1s and a modern machine can process about O(10^8) operations in 1s.

## Problem 2)
Given a directed graph with N nodes and E edges, you have a robot that starts at some node S. The robot has one pre-programed rule, which dictates it to always take a certain directed edge e_i (other than some other directed edges) when it is at some node n_i. Additionally, some nodes count for destinations where the robot may stop. This robot unfortunately is buggy and can make upto 1 mistake of violating the rule. Find the number of distinct destinations the robot may end up at.

## Problem 3)

Note that the standard binary search definition is "given sorted/zero-indexed array A and some number x, find the idx s.t. A[idx-1] < x <= A[idx]. Assume A[-1]= -inf. A[n] = +inf. for clean notation.". Suppose the modified binary serach definition "given sorted/zero-indexed array A and some number x, find the idx s.t. A[idx] <= x < A[idx+1]. Assume for simplicity A[-1] = -inf and A[n] = +inf.". Give the algorithm and/or the set of loop invariants. Argue why your algorithm / set of loop invariants are correct.
